Developer Portfolio and Learning Site Guide

✅ Overview

You’re creating a website that documents your learning journey in:
	•	Swift & SwiftUI
	•	Systems Design
	•	GPU Programming (Metal)

The site should serve as both a portfolio and a technical blog, updated continuously, with a clean, minimalist developer aesthetic. The focus is bottom-up learning, so your site will include content at all levels: foundational, applied, and conceptual.

⸻

🧱 Content Structure

Organize your site with a clear structure:
	•	Home: Intro, mission, latest updates
	•	Blog/Tutorials: Deep dives, findings, explanations
	•	Projects/Demos: Visual/interactive presentations of your work
	•	Portfolio: Concise display of capabilities with filters/tags
	•	About/Contact: Your background and contact method

Use simple top-level navigation or a sidebar layout with clear headings.

✍️ Article and Post Styles

Use multiple formats to engage technical and non-technical readers:

🧪 Tutorials
	•	Step-by-step with visuals and code
	•	Real-world use cases
	•	Highlight problems and how you solved them

🧠 Concept Explainers
	•	Start from first principles
	•	Connect low-level mechanisms to high-level use

🧩 Project Showcases
	•	Purpose, tools used, what you learned
	•	Embed GIFs, interactive previews

💡 Cool Findings / Snippets
	•	Short, insightful discoveries
	•	Visual when possible

🎨 Design & UX Guidelines

Minimalist, Developer-Centric Design
	•	Fonts: Inter, SF Mono, JetBrains Mono, GT America 
	•	Colors: Light/dark mode support, soft neutrals
	•	Layout: Generous spacing, low clutter, focused content

Use Visual Anchors
	•	Diagrams for architecture or system flow
	•	Before/after images for UI transitions or effects
	•	Interactive elements for Metal or SwiftUI demos

Typography
	•	Use headers (##, ###) to break up posts
	•	Use code blocks and inline code for clarity
	•	Avoid large paragraphs

⸻

🛠️ Technical Stack Suggestions
	•	Frontend: Next.js, Astro, or Eleventy
	•	Styling: Tailwind CSS
	•	Markdown Blog Engine: MDX or Contentlayer
	•	Code Snippets: Shiki or Prism
	•	Deploy: Vercel, Netlify
	•	Custom Domain: Register through Namecheap or Porkbun

⸻

📌 Bonus Tips
	•	Include GitHub links for each project
	•	Embed Metal shader playgrounds using GIFs or canvases
	•	Use tags (e.g., #swift, #metal, #systems) for filtering
	•	Add a timeline or changelog for transparency in progress
